# Kafka  Creeper
Meant to really pair well with a bordeaux or with that other cdc to kafka thing I wrote. Gives you somewhere to see in console what another thing is writing to yer topic.

Basically have another worker/thing publish to yer Kafka topic.

Then attach the app hosting this to the same Kafka.

Then simply Heroku Open and watch the fur fly.

Ta.da.
